Introduction
------------

This is an MIT licensed `flake8 <https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8>`_ plugin
for validating Python code style with the command line code formatting tool
`black <https://github.com/python/black>`_. It is available to install from
the Python Package Index (PyPI):

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-black

Black, *"The Uncompromising Code Formatter"*, is normally run to edit your
Python code in place to match their coding style, a strict subset of the
`PEP 8 style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

The point of this plugin is to be able to run ``black --check ...`` from
within the ``flake8`` plugin ecosystem. You might use this via a ``git``
pre-commit hook, or as part of your continuous integration testing.

Flake8 Validation codes
-----------------------

Early versions of flake8 assumed a single character prefix for the validation
codes, which became problematic with collisions in the plugin ecosystem. Since
v3.0, flake8 has supported longer prefixes, therefore this plugin uses ``BLK``
as its prefix.

====== =======================================================================
Code   Description (*and notes*)
------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BLK100 Black would make changes.
BLK9## Internal error (*various, listed below*):
BLK900 Failed to load file: ...
BLK901 Invalid input.
BLK998 Could not access flake8 line length setting (*no longer used*).
BLK999 Unexpected exception.
====== =======================================================================

Note that if your Python code has a syntax error, ``black --check ...`` would
report this as an error. Likewise ``flake8 ...`` will by default report the
syntax error, but importantly it does not seem to then call the plugins, so
you will *not* get an additional ``BLK`` error.


Installation
------------

Python 3.6 or later is required to run ``black``, so that is recommended, but
``black`` can be used on Python code written for older versions of Python.

Install ``flake8-black`` using ``pip``, which should install ``flake8`` and
``black`` as well if not already present::

    $ pip install flake8-black

The new validator should be automatically included when using ``flake8`` which
may now report additional validation codes starting with ``BLK`` (as defined
above). For example::

    $ flake8 example.py

You can request only the ``BLK`` codes be shown using::

    $ flake8 --select BLK example.py


Configuration
-------------

We assume you are familiar with `flake8 configuration
<http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_ and
`black configuration
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyproject_toml.html>`_.

We recommend using the following settings in your ``flake8`` configuration,
for example in your ``.flake8``, ``setup.cfg``, or ``tox.ini`` file::

    [flake8]
    # Recommend matching the black line length (default 88),
    # rather than using the flake8 default of 79:
    max-line-length = 88
    extend-ignore =
        # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373
        E203,

Note currently ``pycodestyle`` gives false positives on the spaces ``black``
uses for slices, which ``flake8`` reports as ``E203: whitespace before ':'``.
Until `pyflakes issue 373 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373>`_
is fixed, and ``flake8`` is updated, we suggest disabling this style check.

If a ``pyproject.toml`` file is found, the plugin will look at the following
``black`` settings:

* ``target_version``
* ``skip_string_normalization``
* ``line_length``

The plugin does *NOT* consider the ``black`` settings for ``include`` and
``exclude``, which would duplicate functionality built into ``flake8``.


Ignoring validation codes
-------------------------

Using the flake8 no-quality-assurance pragma comment is not recommended
(e.g. adding ``# noqa: BLK100`` to the first line black would change).
Instead use the black pragma comments ``# fmt: off`` at the start, and
``# fmt: on`` at the end, of any region of your code which should not be
changed.
